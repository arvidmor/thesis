One study by Richter and Oriol \cite{richter2009} introduce a framework for developing DSU-friendly systems in embedded devices. Their framework is based on dividing the system into components which can be swapped out independently of one another, providing a high degree of flexibility when it comes to DSU. They also show that their framework can meet real-time deadlines as small as 3.3ms including a state transfer of a  4000 byte state. This approach is promising for when it can be considered at the start of a project, since it requires dividing the system into components and integrating the framework. For systems already in production, it would require a significant amount of refactoring to implement, which can be costly and prone to introduce errors.
